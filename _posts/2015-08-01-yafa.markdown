description: For this project I used the Ruby on Rails framework to create an app for language learners. Yafa allows users to upload video, pdf, and audio files which I implemented using the Paperclip gem for file modeling and Dropbox for file storage. I also used the Redcarpet gem to provide text formatting. In addition to uploading documents, users can also create lists of vocabulary words and review these lists in a matching game. The mactching game is implemented using HTML, CSS and the JQuery and JQuery UI JavaScript libraries. Scoring data is collected via Ajax calls and populates a scoring dashboard.
