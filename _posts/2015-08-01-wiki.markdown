description: Used the Sinatra framework to create a CMS for a fictional bakery that allows the creation of articles with tagging and categorization. Combined Bcrypt and Sinatra's session feature to allow user authentication and implemented an email notifcation system for page edits using the SendGrid service and the associated SendGrid Ruby gem. Also implemented text formatting using the Redcarpet ruby gem.
